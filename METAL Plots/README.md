    1. Pie Chart moving - level wise cache occupancy along a given timeline
    2. Stacked bar graph - Intensity of eviction the (eviction rate) for gived levels along a timeline.
    3. Bar Graphs - Non primitive METAL levels saved due to shortcircuiting. Argument for domain specific tags. vs Generic Addresses.
