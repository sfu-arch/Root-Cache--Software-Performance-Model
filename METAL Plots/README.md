METAL Plots list:

Architectural Model

1. Address Based Cache Trace Plots
    1. Pie Chart moving - level wise cache occupancy along a given timeline
    2. Stacked bar graph - Intensity of eviction the (eviction rate) for gived levels along a timeline.
    3. Bar Graphs - Non primitive METAL levels saved due to shortcircuiting. Argument for domain specific tags. vs Generic Addresses.

2. Gem5-S : 
    1. Index Cache vs Address Based Cache for sequential search  latency. Latency vs Cache Size.


3. Primitive Plots (Reactive) : 
    1. Gather (Level Vs Basic) : tuned parameters vs fixed basic model occupancy per level (ordered search key set)
    2. Gather (Level Vs Basic) : tuned parameyers vs fixed basic model performance plot (ordered search key set)
    4. Gather (Level Vs Key) : Tuned Parameters Gather Vs Moving Key Gather Vs basic performance plot (in levels traversed)
    5. Gather (Level Vs Key) : Occupancy per level (FSME: Full Search Motion Estimation; y^2 = 4ax)
